title: "Record Linkage at the Duke GPSG Community Pantry"
description: |
  The Duke Graduate and Professional Student Government (GPSG) Community Pantry is a student-operated food pantry serving the student community at Duke University. In this post, I describe the record linkage system used at the Pantry to identify individual customers and obtain their order history. This is done using a Python module for deterministic record linkage and model evaluation techniques which I describe in detail.
