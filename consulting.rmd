I am available for consulting on a variety of topics, including record linkage and deduplication, survey methods, data analysis, R/Python package development, and statistical learning. My advanced skills in data science, machine learning, and applied research, as well as my programming skills in Python and R, make me well-equipped to tackle a wide range of data-driven projects.

I have gained practical experience through internships and academic research, and have developed and published multiple software packages. I have experience in project management and leadership, having led teams of interns on data science projects, managed a large research collaboration, and supervised data-labeling staff. I am also skilled in teaching and mentoring, and have led weekly labs on topics such as entity resolution, spatio-temporal models, Bayesian and modern statistics, and introduction to data science.

Some of my notable accomplishments include:

- Developing and implementing a model evaluation and improvement strategy for machine learning-based entity resolution systems at the American Institutes for Research
- Developing and implementing uncertainty quantification and Bayesian optimization methods for pricing optimization at the Intact Financial Corporation
- Developing survey methodology for food insecurity monitoring adopted by Duke University
- Training and leading undergraduate students on internship projects involving data analysis and web development for the Information Initiative at Duke
- Publishing research papers on Bayesian nonparametric inference in top journals such as the Journal of Machine Learning Research, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, and Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential consulting projects. I look forward to the opportunity to work with you!
