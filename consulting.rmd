I consult with small and medium-sized businesses on the topics of record linkage and deduplication, survey methods, data analysis, R/Python package development, and statistical learning. 

Specifically, I can help you and your team:

- Validate your approaches and statistical methodology.
- Improve your data science software development practices and ensure the reproducibility of your data analyses.
- Quantify uncertainty surrounding your predictions and inferences using conformal prediction, resampling, and Bayesian methods.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of your programs and activites through data and experiments.
- Integrate data from multiple sources using record linkage and entity resolution algorithms.
- Train your staff to effectively work with R, Python, git, and bash as part of a data science workflow.

## What to expect

My goal is to understand the problem you're facing and the outcome that you are looking for. If we determine that I'm a good fit, I will then send you a work plan, a pricing estimate, and a draft consulting agreement for your approval.

My priority is to *make happen* your desired outcome. I will work with you to define a project scope which is compatible with your budget and which brings significant value to your organization.
