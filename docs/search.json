See my research, teaching, software, and blog.\nAbout me\nI am a PhD Candidate in the Statistical Science Department at Duke\nUniversity. I have a Mathematics B.Sc. and a Statistics M.Sc. from\nUniversit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al. My research is currently supported by\nProfessor Jerry Reiter at Duke, by an Alexander-Graham-Bell Canada\nGraduate Scholarship, and by a doctoral award from the Fonds de\nRecherche du Qu√©bec - Nature et Technologies. I was awarded the Canada\nGovernor General‚Äôs Academic Medal in 2020 for outstanding academic\nachievements during my M.Sc.\nI have broad ranging interests in statistics. My M.Sc. research\nfocused on theoretical properties of Bayesian nonparametric procedures.\nRecently, I have been working on more applied problems. I am\nparticularly interested in the statistical evaluation of machine\nlearning systems and in entity resolution for big data integration. My\nwork intersects machine learning, survey methods, statistical\nevaluation, and privacy considerations.\nDuring Spring 2022, I was working as a Data Scientist intern at the\nIntact\nFinancial Corporation. I was part of the Rating Revolution team\nwhich develops machine learning models to improve the pricing of\ninsurance products.\n\nDuring Summer 2022, I was working as a Data Scientist/Researcher\nIntern at the American Institutes for\nResearch. I worked on the entity resolution algorithms used for PatentsView.org, a patents knowledge\ndiscovery platform led by the Office of the Chief Economist at the U.S.\nPatent & Trademark Office. I developed novel evaluation methodology\nfor entity resolution systems (see our paper).\nIn my free time, I like to get involved with other students at Duke.\nIn 2021-2022, I was Research Coordinator for the Duke\nGPSG Community Pantry, helping improve our knowledge of food\ninsecurity on campus. Currently, I am webmaster for the Record Linkage Interest\nGroup. Additionally, I worked with the Duke Applied Machine Learning\nGroup and with the Data+ program as a project manager, and I have been a\nmentor for the Twoples directed reading program. I am very grateful for\nour international academic community and I try to give back as I can. I\nregularly mentor undergraduate students working on research projects\nwith me.\nLastly, I spend some time working on open source projects related to\nmy research. I maintain three R packages on CRAN and I am actively\nworking on an open source\nPython library for scalable fuzzy string matching. My work is\nsupported by individual contributors through Github Sponsors\nand by G-Research.\nSponsor me\nSponsor my open source work and community involvement through\nGithub:\n\n\n\n\nHire me\nI consult with small and medium-sized businesses on the topics of\nrecord linkage and deduplication, survey methods, data analysis,\nR/Python package development, and statistical learning.
