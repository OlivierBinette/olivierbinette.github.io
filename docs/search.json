    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nDuke‚Äôs Graduate and Professional Student Government (GPSG) has been operating a community food pantry for about five years. The pantry provides nonperishable food and basic need items to graduate and professional students on campus. There is a weekly bag program, where students order customized bags of food to be picked up on Saturdays, as well as an in-person shopping program open on Thursdays and Saturdays.\n\nFigure 1: Weekly number of customers at the Pantry. The black line is a moving average of weekly visits.\n\n\nThe weekly bag program, which began in May 2018 and is still the most popular pantry offering, provides quite a bit of data regarding pantry customers and their habits. Some customers have ordered more than 80 times in the past 2 years, while others only ordered once or twice. For every bag order, we have the customer‚Äôs first name and last initial, an email address (which became mandatory around mid 2018), a phone number in a few cases, an address in some cases (for delivery), we have demographic information some cases, and we have the food order information. Available quasi-identifying information is shown in Table 1 below.\n\nTable 1: Quasi-identifying information provided on Qualtrics bag order forms. Note that phone number and address were only required while delivery was offered. Furthermore, most customers stop answering demographic questions after a few orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion no.\nQuestion\nAnswer form\nMandatory?\n\n\n\n\n-\nIP address\n-\nYes\n\n\n2\nFirst name and last initial\nFree form\nYes\n\n\n3\nDuke email\nFree form\nYes\n\n\n4\nPhone number\nFree form\nNo\n\n\n6\nAddress\nFree form\nNo\n\n\n8\nFood allergies\nFree form\nNo\n\n\n9\nNumber of members in household\n1-2 or 3+\nYes\n\n\n10\nWant baby bag?\nYes or no\nYes\n\n\n30\nDegree\nMultiple choices or Other\nNo\n\n\n31\nSchool\nMultiple choices or Other\nNo\n\n\n32\nYear in graduate school\nMultiple choices\nNo\n\n\n33\nNumber of adults in household\nMultiple choices\nNo\n\n\n34\nNumber of children in household\nMultiple choices\nNo\n\n\n\nGaining the most insight from this data requires linking order records from the same customer. Identifying individual customers and associating them with an order history allows us to investigate shopping recurrence patterns and identify potential issues with the pantry‚Äôs offering. For instance, we can know who stopped ordering from the pantry after the home delivery program ended. These are people who, most likely, do not have a car to get to the pantry but might benefit from new programs, such as a ride-share program or a gift card program.\nThis blog post describes the way in which records are linked at the Community Pantry. As we will see, the record linkage problem is not particularly difficult. It is not trivial either, however, and it does require care to ensure that it runs reliably and efficiently, and that it is intelligible and properly validated. This post goes in detail into these two aspects of the problem.\nRegarding efficiency and reliability of the software system, I describe the development of a Python module, called GroupByRule, for record linkage at the pantry. This Python module is maintainable, documented and tested, ensuring reliability of the system and the potential for its continued use throughout the years, even as technical volunteers change at the pantry. Regarding validation of the record linkage system, I describe simple steps that can be taken to evaluate model performance.\nBefore jumping into the technical part, let‚Äôs take a step back to discuss the issue of food insecurity on campus.\n\nFood Insecurity on Campus\nIt is often surprising to people that some Duke students might struggle having access to food. After all, Duke is one of the richest campuses in the US with its 12 billion endowment, high tuition and substantial research grants. Prior to the covid-19 pandemic, this wealth could be seen on campus and benefit many. Every weekday, there were several conferences and events with free food. Me and many other graduate students would participate in these events, earning 3-4 free lunches every week. Free food on campus is now a thing of the past, for the most part.\nHowever, free lunch or not, it‚Äôs important to realize the many financial challenges which students can face. International students on F-1 and J-1 visas have limited employment opportunities in the US. Many graduate students are married, have children or have other dependents which may not be eligible to work in the US either. Even if they are lucky enough to be paid a 9 or 12-month stipend, this stipend doesn‚Äôt go very far. For other students, going to Duke means living on a mixture of loans, financial aid, financial support from parents, and side jobs. Any imbalance in this rigid system can leave students having to compromise between their education and their health.\nA 2019 study from the World Food Policy Center reported that about 19% of graduate and professional students at Duke experienced food insecurity in the past year. This means they were unable to afford a balanced and sufficient diet, they were afraid of not having enough money for food, or they skipped meals and went hungry due to lack of money. The GPSG Community Pantry has been leading efforts to expand food insecurity monitoring on campus ‚Äì we are hoping to have more data in 2022 and in following years."

    "section": "The Record Linkage Approach",
    "text": "The Record Linkage Approach\nThe bag order form contains email addresses which are highly reliable for linkage. If two records have the same email, we know for certain that they are from the same customer. However, customers do not always enter the same email address when submitting orders. Despite the request to use a Duke email address, some customers use personal emails. Furthermore, Duke email addresses have two forms. For instance, my duke email is both ob37@duke.edu and olivier.binette@duke.edu. Emails are therefore not sufficient for linkage. Phone numbers can be used as well, but these are only available for the period when home delivery was available.\nFirst name and last initial can be used to supplement emails and phone numbers. Again, agreement on first name and last initial provides strong evidence for match. On the other hand, people do not always enter their names in the same way.\nCombining the use of emails, phone numbers, and names, we may therefore link records which agree on any one of these attributes. This is a simple deterministic record linkage approach which should be reliable enough for the data analysis use of the pantry.\n\nDeterministic Record Linkage Rule\nTo be more precise, record linkage proceeds as follows:\n\nRecords are processed to clean and standardize the email, phone and name attributes. That is, leading and trailing whitespace are removed, capitalization is standardized, phone numbers are validated and standardized, and punctuation is removed from names.\nRecords which agree on any of their email, phone or name attributes are linked together.\nConnected components of the resulting graph are computed in order to obtain record clusters.\n\nThis record linkage procedure is extremely simple. It relies the fact that all three attributes are reliable indicators of a match and that, for two matching records, it is likely that at least one of these three attributes will be in agreement.\nAlso, the simplicity of the approach allows the use of available additional information (such as IP address and additional questions) for model validation. If the use of this additional information does not highlight any flaws with the simple deterministic approach, then this means that the deterministic approach is already good enough. We will come back to this when discussing model validation techniques.\n\n\nImplementation\nOur deterministic record linkage system is implemented in Python with some generality. The goal is for the system to be able to adapt to changes in data or processes.\nThe fundamental component of the system is a LinkageRule class. LinkageRule objects can be fitted to data, providing either a clustering or a linkage graph. For instance, a LinkageRule might be a rule to link all records which agree on the email attribute. Another LinkageRule might summarize a set of other rules, such as taking the union or intersection of their links.\nThe interface is as follows:\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n\n\nclass LinkageRule(ABC):\n    \"\"\"\n    Interface for a linkage rule which can be fitted to data.\n\n    This abstract class specifies three methods. The `fit()` method fits the \n    linkage rule to a pandas DataFrame. The `graph` property can be used after \n    `fit()` to obtain a graph representing the linkage fitted to data.  The \n    `groups` property can be used after `fit()` to obtain a membership vector \n    representing the clustering fitted to data.\n    \"\"\"\n    @abstractmethod\n    def fit(self, df):\n        pass\n\n    @property\n    @abstractmethod\n    def graph(self):\n        pass\n\n    @property\n    @abstractmethod\n    def groups(self):\n        pass\nNote that group membership vectors, our representation for cluster groups, are meant to be a numpy integer array with entries indicating what group (cluster) a given record belongs to. Such a ‚Äúgroups‚Äù vector should not contain NA values; rather it should contain distinct integers for records that are not in the same cluster.\nWe will now define two other classes, Match and Any, which allow us to implement deterministic record linkage. The Match class implements an exact matching rule, while Any is the logical disjunction of a given set of rules. Our deterministic record linkage rule for the pantry will therefore be defined as follows:\nrule = Any(Match(\"name\"), Match(\"email\"), Match(\"phone\"))\nFollowing the LinkageRule interface, this rule will then be fitted to the data and used as follows:\nrule.fit(data)\ndata.groupby(rule.groups).last() # Get last visit data for all customers.\nThe benefit of this general interface is that it is extendable. By default, the Any class will return connected components when requesting group clusters. However, other clustering approaches could be used. Exact matching rules could also be relaxed to fuzzy matching rules based on string distance metrics or probabilistic record linkage. All of this can be implemented as additional LinkageRule subclasses in a way which is compatible with the above.\nLet‚Äôs now work on the Match class. For efficiency, we‚Äôll want Match to operate at the groups level. That is, if Match is called on a set of rules, then we‚Äôll first compute groups for these rules, before computing the intersection of these groups. This core functionality is implemented in the function _groups_from_rules() below.

This property returns a Graph object corresponding to the matching rule. The graph is built as follows. First, we construct an inverted index for the clustering. That is, we construct a dictionary associating to each cluster the nodes which it contains. Then, an edge list is obtained by linking all pairs of nodes which belong to the same cluster. Note that the pure Python implementation below if not efficient for large clusters. This is not a problem for now since we will generally avoid computing this graph.\n# Part of the definition of the `Match` class:\n    @property\n    def graph(self) -&gt; Graph:\n        if self._update_graph:\n            # Inverted index\n            clust = pd.DataFrame({\"groups\": self.groups}\n                                 ).groupby(\"groups\").indices\n            self._graph = Graph(n=self.n)\n            self._graph.add_edges(itertools.chain.from_iterable(\n                itertools.combinations(c, 2) for c in clust.values()))\n            self._update_graph = False\n        return self._graph\nFinally, let‚Äôs implement the Any class. It‚Äôs purpose is to take the union (i.e.¬†logical disjunction) of a set of rules. Just like for Match, we can choose to operate at the groups or graph level. Here we‚Äôll work at the groups level for efficiency. That is, given a set of rules, Any will first compute their corresponding clusters before merging overlapping clusters.\nThere are quite a few different ways to efficiently merge clusters. Here we‚Äôll merge clusters by computing a ‚Äúpath graph‚Äù representation, taking the union of these graphs, and then computing connected components. For a given clustering, say containing records a, b, and c, the ‚Äúpath graph‚Äù links records as a path a‚Äìb‚Äìc.\nFirst, we define the functions needed to compute path graphs:\ndef pairwise(iterable):\n    \"\"\"\n    Iterate over consecutive pairs:\n        s -&gt; (s[0], s[1]), (s[1], s[2]), (s[2], s[3]), ...\n\n    Note\n    ----\n    Current implementation is from itertools' recipes list available at \n    https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html\n    \"\"\"\n    a, b = itertools.tee(iterable)\n    next(b, None)\n    return zip(a, b)\n\n\ndef _path_graph(rule, df):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute path graph corresponding to the rule's clustering: cluster elements \n    are connected as a path.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    rule: string or LinkageRule\n        Linkage rule for which to compute the corresponding path graph \n        (strings are interpreted as exact matching rules for the corresponding column).\n    df: DataFrame\n        Data to which the linkage rule is fitted.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    Graph object such that nodes in the same cluster (according to the fitted \n    linkage rule) are connected as graph paths.\n    \"\"\"\n    gr = _groups(rule, df)\n    \n    # Inverted index\n    clust = pd.DataFrame({\"groups\": gr}\n                         ).groupby(\"groups\").indices\n    graph = Graph(n=df.shape[0])\n    graph.add_edges(itertools.chain.from_iterable(\n        pairwise(c) for c in clust.values()))\n\n    return graph\nWe can now implement the Any class:\nclass Any(LinkageRule):\n    \"\"\"\n    Class representing the logical disjunction of linkage rules.\n\n    Attributes\n    ----------\n    graph: igraph.Graph\n        Graph representing linkage fitted to the data.

We‚Äôll see in the model evaluation section that these do not affect performance to a large degree. However, for a system used with more data or over a longer timeframe, these should be carefully considered.\nFirst, the deterministic linkage does not allow the consideration of contradictory evidence. For instance, if long-form Duke email addresses are provided on two records and do not agree (e.g.¬†‚Äúolivier.binette@duke.edu‚Äù and ‚Äúolivier.bonhomme@duke.edu‚Äù are provided), then we know for sure that the records do not correspond to the same individual, even if the same name was provided (here Olivier B.). The consideration of such evidence could rely on probabilistic record linkage, where each record pair is associated a match probability.\nSecond, the use of connected components to resolve transitivity can be problematic, as a single spurious link could connect two large clusters by mistake. More sophisticated graph clustering techniques, in combination with probabilistic record linkage, would be required to mitigate the issue."

    "section": "Model Evaluation",
    "text": "Model Evaluation\nI cannot share any of the data which we have at the Pantry. However, I can describe general steps to be taken to evaluate model performance in practice.\n\nPairwise Precision and Recall\nHere we will evaluate linkage performance using pairwise precision \\(P\\) and recall \\(R\\). The precision \\(P\\) is defined as the proportion of predicted links which are true matches, whereas \\(R\\) is the proportion of true matches which are correctly predicted. That is, if \\(TP\\) is the number of true positive links, \\(P\\) the number of predicted links, and \\(T\\) the number of true matches, then we have \\[\nP = TP/P, \\quad R = TP/T.\n\\]\n\nEstimating Precision\nIt is helpful to express precision and recall in cluster form, where cluster elements are all interlinked. Let \\(C\\) be the set of true clusters and let \\(\\hat C\\) be the set of predicted clusters. For a given cluster \\(\\hat c \\in \\hat C\\), let \\(C \\cap \\hat c\\) be the restriction of the clustering \\(C\\) to \\(\\hat c\\). Then we have \\[\n  P = \\frac{\\sum_{\\hat c \\in \\hat C} \\sum_{e \\in C \\cap \\hat c} {\\lvert e\\rvert \\choose 2} }{ \\sum_{\\hat c \\in \\hat C} {\\lvert \\hat c \\rvert \\choose 2}}.\n\\]\nThe denominator can be computed exactly, while the numerator can be estimated by randomly sampling clusters \\(\\hat c \\in \\hat C\\), breaking them up into true clusters \\(e \\in C \\cap \\hat c\\), and then computing the sum of the combinations \\({\\lvert e\\rvert \\choose 2}\\). Importance sampling could be used to reduce the variance of the estimator, but it does not seem necessary for the scale of the data which we have at the pantry, where each predicted cluster can be examined quite quickly.\nIn practice, the precision estimation process can be carried out as follows:\n\nSample predicted clusters at random (in the case of the pantry, we can take all predicted clusters).\nMake a spreadsheet with all the records corresponding to the sampled clusters.\nSort the spreadsheet by predicted cluster ID.\nAdd a new empty column to the spreadsheet, called ‚ÄútrueSubClusters‚Äù.\nSeparately look at each predicted cluster. If the cluster should be broken up in multiple parts, use the ‚ÄútrueSubClusters‚Äù column to provide identifiers for true cluster membership. Note that these identifiers do not need to match across predicted clusters.\n\nThe spreadsheet can then be read-in and processed in a straightforward way to obtain an estimated precision value.\n\n\nEstimating Recall\nEstimating recall is a bit trickier than estimating precision, but we can make one assumption to simplify the process. Assume that precision is exactly 1, or very close to 1, so that all predicted clusters can roughly be taken at face value. Estimating recall then boils to the problem of identifying which predicted clusters should be merged together.\nIndeed, using the same notations as above, we can write \\[\nR = \\frac{\\sum_{ c \\in  C} \\sum_{e \\in \\hat C \\cap  c} {\\lvert e\\rvert \\choose 2} }{ \\sum_{ c \\in  C} {\\lvert  c \\rvert \\choose 2}}.\n\\] If precision is 1, then the denominator can be computed from the sizes of predicted clusters which are identified to be merged. On the other hand, the nominator simplifies to \\(\\sum_{e \\in \\hat C}{\\lvert e \\rvert \\choose 2}\\) which can be computed exactly from the sizes of predicted clusters. In the case of the Pantry, wrongly separated clusters are likely to be due to small differences in names and emails. Our procedure to identify clusters which should have been merged together is as follows:\n\nMake a spreadsheet containing canonical customer records (one representative record for each predicted individual customer).\nCreate a new empty column named ‚ÄútrueClustersA‚Äù.\nSort the spreadsheet by name.\nGo through the spreadsheet from top to bottom, looking at whether or not consecutive predicted clusters should be merged together. If so, write a corresponding cluster membership ID in the ‚ÄútrueClustersA‚Äù column.\nCreate a new empty column named ‚ÄútrueClustersB‚Äù.\nSort the spreadsheet by email\nGo through the spreadsheet from top to bottom, looking at whether or not consecutive predicted clusters should be merged together. If so, write a corresponding cluster membership ID in the ‚ÄútrueClustersB‚Äù column.\n\nThis process might not catch all wrongly separated clusters, but it is likely to find many of the errors due to different ways of writing names and different email addresses. The resulting spreadsheet can then easily be processed to obtain an estimated recall. If we were working with a larger dataset, we‚Äôd have to use further blocking to restrict our consideration to a more manageable subset of the data.\n\n\n\nResults\nI used the above procedures to estimate precision and recall of our simple deterministic approach to deduplicate the Pantry‚Äôs data. There was a total of 3281 bag order records for 689 estimated customers. The results are below.\nEstimated Precision: 92%\nPrecision is somewhat low due to about 3 relatively large clusters (around 30-50 records each) which should have been broken up in a few parts. 2% precision was lost due to a couple that shared a phone number, where each had about 20 order records. The vast majority of spurious links were tied to bag orders for which only the first name was provided (e.g.¬†‚ÄúSam‚Äù). The use of negative evidence to distinguish between individuals would help resolve these cases.\nEstimated Recall: 99.6%\nThis is certainly an overestimate, but it does show that missing links are not obviously showing up. Given the structure of the Pantry data, it is likely that recall is indeed quite high."

As previously discussed, probabilistic record linkage would allow the consideration of negative evidence and the use of additional quasi-identifying information (such as IP addresses and other responses on the bag order forms). I‚Äôm looking forward to building on the GroupByRule Python module to provide a user-friendly and unified interface to more flexible methodology.\nHowever, it is important to ensure that any record linkage approach is intelligible and rooted in a good understanding of the underlying data. In this context, the use of a well-thought deterministic approach can provide good performance, at least as a first step or baseline for comparison. Furthermore, it is important to spend sufficient time investigating the results of the linkage to evaluate performance. I have highlighted simple steps which can be taken to estimate precision and make a good effort at identifying missing links. This is highly informative for model validation, improvement, and for the interpretation of any following results."

This defines requirements for my function and lets me check it. The first tests should be simple and useful for development.

    "text": "Essentially all of my work involves reading and writing. I write papers and proposals, code, documentation, emails, and I jot down thoughts in problem-solving sessions. And all of that is in relation to the writings and ideas of an incredibly large number of people.\nKeeping up with all this information requires knowledge management systems. They are often integrated into our online experiences - we have bookmarks, searchable email inboxes, online code repositories, etc.\nBut some effort is needed to use these systems effectively, without being overwhelmed by all of these disparate systems. That‚Äôs where personal knowledge management comes in.\nIt‚Äôs not a new idea. For millennia, beginning at least with Aristotle, writers have been using ‚Äúcommonplace‚Äú books to organize their notes, quotes, and ideas. Stephen Johnson, in the book Where Good Ideas Come From, relates Darwin‚Äôs notebooks to this tradition:\n\nDarwin‚Äôs notebooks lie at the tail end of a long and fruitful tradition that peaked in Enlightenment-era Europe, particularly in England: the practice of maintaining a ‚Äòcommonplace‚Äô book. Scholars, amateur scientists, aspiring men of letters - just about anyone with intellectual ambition in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was likely to keep a commonplace book. The great minds of the period - Milton, Bacon, Locke - were zealous believers in the memory-enhancing powers of the commonplace book.\n\nSomething as simple as the ‚Äúnotes‚Äù app on your phone, or sending yourself emails, can work well enough for note-taking. But we can get much more out of our notes by using technology to help index notes, create connections between them, and help summarize and extract relevant information when needed.\nTechnology can also help us overcome the challenges of determining how to organize notes. Personally, I cannot keep any file tree well organized. There is an alternative: instead of a hierarchical tree, we can organize notes in a graph using tags and links. This is how Wikipedia is structured. You don‚Äôt find a wiki page by going down a file tree. Rather, you do keyword searches and follow links between pages.\nMy favorite tool for this is Obsidian (at work I use Confluence). Previously I used Notion, and before that I only used paper. Obsidian is free, easy-to-use, private (it‚Äôs a desktop app!), and responsive. I use it to keep track of everything that isn‚Äôt my paper notepad, emails, or LaTeX/Word documents.\n\nThere are lots of other tools available:\n\n\n\nhypothes.is for web annotation\nRoam\nNotion\n\n\n\nLogseq\nDendron\nDatabyss\n\n\n\nIn short, it‚Äôs easy to take modern digital features like hypertext or search for granted. But it‚Äôs really amazing how far we‚Äôve come to get here, and I think we can do even more amazing things if we can use these features to their full extent or push them even further.\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CopyrightOlivier Binette"

It‚Äôs about combining data and context to make valid inferences. Data on its own has no meaning. Missing data - including both the data you wish you had and the data you don‚Äôt even know you‚Äôre missing - is more important than the data you have. A statistician‚Äôs work is to help learn about such unknowns. It‚Äôs a fallacy to make decisions based only on available data - the McNamara fallacy.\n\n‚ÄúBut when the McNamara discipline is applied too literally, the first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. The second step is to disregard that which can‚Äôt easily be measured or given a quantitative value. The third step is to presume that what can‚Äôt be measured easily really isn‚Äôt important. The fourth step is to say that what can‚Äôt be easily measured really doesn‚Äôt exist. This is suicide.‚Äù ‚Äî Daniel Yankelovich, ‚ÄúInterpreting the New Life Styles‚Äù, Sales Management (1971)\n\nThe problem isn‚Äôt data or measurement. In fact, you should aim to measure as much as you can, as often as you can. You should build measurement and observability as core components of your systems and infrastructures. You should work to continually improve your approach to measurement of what matters. And you should have statisticians or data scientists make sense of these numbers through their context, given specific goals.\nBut here‚Äôs the thing: measurement is not management.\nAs a manager, your job is to create and maintain structures that drive customer value and continuous improvement. To achieve this, you need to think about knowns (i.e., data, metrics) and unknowns. Statisticians or data scientists can help you contextualize data and shed light on unknowns, athough it‚Äôs not always an easy process."

The Monte-Carlo estimate of \\(I\\) is\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i), \\qquad x_i \\sim \\mu.\\)\n\nWhen it is too difficult to sample \\(\\mu\\), for instance, other estimates can be obtained. Suppose that \\(\\mu\\) is absolutely continuous with respect to another probability measure \\(\\lambda\\), and that the density of \\(\\mu\\) with respect to \\(\\lambda\\) is given by \\(\\rho\\). Another unbiaised estimate of \\(I\\) is then\n\n\\(I_n(f) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n f(y_i)\\rho(y_i),\\qquad y_i \\sim \\lambda.\\)\n\nThis is the general framework of importance sampling, with the Monte-Carlo estimate recovered by taking \\(\\lambda = \\mu\\). An important question is the following.\n\nHow large should \\(n\\) be for \\(I_n(f)\\) to be close to \\(I(f)\\)?\n\nAn answer is given, under certain conditions, by Chatterjee and Diaconis (2015). Their main result can be interpreted as follows. If \\(X \\sim \\mu\\) and if \\(\\log \\rho(X)\\) is concentrated around its expected value \\(L=\\text{E}[\\log \\rho(X)]\\), then a sample size of approximately \\(n = e^{L}\\) is both necessary and sufficient for \\(I_n\\) to be close to \\(I\\). The exact sample size needed depends on \\(\\|f\\|_{L^2(\\mu)}\\) and on the tail behavior of \\(\\log\\rho(X)\\). I state below their theorem with a small modification.\nTheorem 1. (Chatterjee and Diaconis, 2015) As above, let \\(X \\sim \\mu\\). For any \\(a \\gt; 0\\) and \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\),\n\n\\(\\mathbb{E} |I_n(f) - I(f)| \\le \\|f\\|_{L^2(\\mu)}\\left( \\sqrt{a/n} + 2\\sqrt{\\mathbb{P} (\\rho(X) \\gt; a)} \\right).\\)\n\nConversely, for any \\(\\delta \\in (0,1)\\) and \\(b \\gt; 0\\),\n\n\\(\\mathbb{P}(1 - I_n(1) \\le \\delta) \\le \\frac{n}{b} + \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(\\rho(X) \\le b)}{1-\\delta}.\\)\n\nRemark 1. Suppose \\(\\|f\\|_{L^2(\\mu)} \\le 1\\) and that \\(\\log\\rho(X)\\) is concentrated around \\(L = \\mathbb{E} \\log\\rho(X)\\), meaning that for some \\(t \\gt; 0\\) we have that \\(\\mathbb{P}(\\log \\rho(X) \\gt; L+t/2)\\) and \\(\\mathbb{P}(\\log\\rho(X) \\lt; L-t/2)\\) are both less than an arbitrary \\(\\varepsilon \\gt; 0\\). Then, taking \\(n \\geq e^{L+t}\\) we find\n\n$ |I_n(f) - I| e^{-t/4} + 2.$\n\nHowever, if $n e^{L-t} $, we obtain\n\n$ (1 - I_n(1) ) e^{-t/2} + 2 .$\n\nmeaning that there can be a high probability that \\(I(1)\\) and \\(I_n(1)\\) are not close.\nRemark 2. Let \\(\\lambda = \\mu\\), so that \\(\\rho = 1\\). In that case, \\(\\log\\rho(X)\\) only takes its expected value \\(0\\). The theorem yields\n\n\\(\\mathbb{E} |I_n(f) - I(f)| \\le \\frac{\\|f\\|_{L^2(\\mu)}}{\\sqrt{n}}\\)\n\nand no useful bound on \\(\\mathbb{P}(1-I_n(1) \\le \\delta)\\).\nComment. For the theorem to yield a sharp cutoff, it is necessary that \\(L = \\mathbb{E} \\log\\rho(X)\\) be relatively large and that \\(\\log\\rho(X)\\) be highly concentrated around \\(L\\). The first condition is not aimed at in the practice of importance sampling. This difficulty contrasts with the broad claim that ‚Äúa sample of size approximately \\(e^{L}\\) is necessary and sufficient for accurate estimation by importance sampling‚Äù. The result in conceptually interesting, but I‚Äôm not convinced that a sharp cutoff is common.\n\nExample\n\nI consider their example 1.4. Here \\(\\lambda\\) is the exponential distribution of mean \\(1\\), \\(\\mu\\) is the exponential distribution of mean 2, \\(\\rho(x) = e^{x/2}/2\\) and \\(f(x) = x\\). Thus \\(I(f) = 2\\). We have \\(L = \\mathbb{E}\\log\\rho(X) = 1-\\log(2) \\approxeq 0.3\\), meaning that the theorem yields no useful cutoff. Furthermore, \\({}\\mathbb{P}(\\rho(X) \\gt; a) = \\tfrac{1}{2a}\\) and \\(\\|f\\|_{L^2(\\mu)} = 2\\). Optimizing the bound given by the theorem yields\n\n\\(\\mathbb{E}|I_n(f)-2| \\le \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{(2n)^{1/4}}.\\)\n\nThe figure below shows \\(100\\) trajectories of \\(I_k(f)\\). The shaded area bounds the expected error.\n\nThis next figure shows \\(100\\) trajectories for the Monte-Carlo estimate of \\(2 = \\int x d\\mu\\), taking \\(\\lambda = \\mu\\) and \\(\\rho = 1\\). Here the theorem yields\n\n\\(\\mathbb{E}|I_n(f)-2| \\le \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n}}.\\)\n\n\nReferences.\nChatterjee, S. and Diaconis, P.

Also, by Brouwer‚Äôs fixed point theorem, there exists \\(x_0 \\in D\\) such that \\(\\phi_{\\delta / M}(x_0) = x_0\\). This yields a closed orbit \\(\\Gamma = \\{\\phi_t(x_0) \\,|\\, t \\geq 0\\}\\) such that any two points on \\(\\Gamma\\) are at distance at most \\(\\delta\\) from each other. Since \\(\\Gamma\\) is closed, there must exist \\(a,b \\in \\Gamma\\) such that \\(\\langle f(a), f(b) \\rangle \\leq 0\\). Hence we find that \\(\\|f(a) - f(b)\\| \\gt; \\|f(a)\\| \\gt; \\alpha\\), even though \\(\\|a-b\\| \\lt; \\delta\\). This is impossible. Thus \\(\\|f\\|\\) is not bounded away from zero and \\(f\\) must have a zero in the compact \\(D\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\nProof of the corollary.When \\(k=2\\), the Jordan-Brouwer theorem implies that closed orbits separate the plane in two connected components, one of which is bounded. Schoenflies‚Äô theorem, strengthening the above, ensures that the union of bounded component with the closed orbit is diffeomorphic to the closed disk. Invariance follows from the unicity of the solution to initial value problems when \\(f\\) is \\(\\mathcal{C}^1\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\nThis can be generalized as follows. For the sake of mixing things up, we state the result in topological terms.\n\n\nTheorem¬†(Particular case of the Poincar√©-Hopf theorem).Let \\(M\\) be a compact submanifold of \\(\\mathbb{R}^k\\) with non-zero Euler characteristic \\(\\chi(M)\\), and let \\(\\phi : [0,1] \\times M \\rightarrow M : (t,x) \\mapsto \\phi_t(x)\\) be a smooth¬† isotopy.

Let me explain in the context of software development.\nSay you‚Äôre building a piece of software for some use case. There‚Äôs a lot that goes into building and deploying the software: the UI, the logic, the backend, the deployment infrastructure, the iterative changes, etc. Each part contributes more or less to the functionality a user can see.\nIn this plot, UI+logic+backend is 80% of the functionality* the user can see, but only 40% of the required effort to complete the project.\nIf functionality and effort are uncorrelated or negatively correlated, then building the most functionality first will lead to decreasing return of efforts on functionality over the project‚Äôs life. The smallest set of components that contribute to 80% functionality is a biased selection that isn‚Äôt representative of the overall effort distribution.\nThis doesn‚Äôt mean that the 80% seen functionality is more important than the other 20%.

    "section": "Why Software Projects Fail",
    "text": "Why Software Projects Fail\nThe Pareto principle plays into the common failure (or cost overrun, scope creep, technical debt) of software projects.\nOften, development teams prioritize building a minimal viable product (MVP), or delivering the most apparent functionality for a given effort level. The fast achievement of 80% functionality can lead to poor expectations of what‚Äôs needed to reach a product that has actual value, i.e.¬†something maintainable and deployable. Clients, project managers, and developers can misunderstand the scope of project if they rank tasks in functionality-first order, without considering the full value chain.\n\nA Better Approach - Managing Risks And the Full Value Chain\nAs part of good project management, you want to:\n\nMap risks and uncertainties, and address the most important ones first.\nDeliver self-contained value to the client throughout the project, if possible.\n\nE.g. for (1), if you don‚Äôt know what a client wants, that‚Äôs a big risk. Getting an MVP in front of them might help reduce uncertainties and mitigate that risk. A cost overrun is also a big risk. If you don‚Äôt know how long it will take to build the infrastructure to deploy your system, then you might want to address that first.\nFor (2), note that value is not always the same as functionality. Undeployed functionality has no value to a client. An MVP, unless it is truly viable on its own, typically has little value to a client. A product that doesn‚Äôt meet quality requirements does not have any value. If clients hire you for software development, value is something they can use without any further software development."

    "text": "Innovation is creating and delivering new value to customers.\nIt happens at different levels. R&D projects are often expected to fail, but have potential for breakthroughs. Bringing existing technology to new markets is also a form of innovation, possibly with a higher success rate. Incremental optimizations and process improvements also involve innovation and are essential to an efficient business.\nInnovation begins with someone having an idea they think could be valuable. Developing that idea and bringing it to customers requires time an energy.\nA value proposition is what explains why this time and energy should be expended.\nCurtis R. Carlson, ex-President of SRI International, developed a framework for value propositions. It has four main components (the ‚ÄúNABCs‚Äù) that aim to answer essential business questions:\nAdditionally, there should be a driving force behind the proposition, i.e.¬†motivated people willing and able to push this forward. The value proposition should also be aligned with the organization, both to support its development and enable capturing resulting value.\nBuilding a good value proposition is an iterative process. The customer need is what matters and the approach might change - don‚Äôt fall in love with an idea. Focus on customer needs and the reasons underlying what they say they want. Try to quantify the value proposition, even if some of it may be guesswork. Address the most major risks and uncertainties first, before trying to build everything. Maintain and adjust the value proposition throughout the project."

They are indeed simple, but not simplistic. The four following carefully crafted questions work wonders in virtually any situation. The first three are usually glossed over in the rush to answer the fourth.\n\nWhat are we trying to accomplish and why?\nThe question of what the project should accomplish - and more importantly - why it needs to be done, deserves fine-tuned attention because those answers drive everything else. In the rush to decide on the how, who, and when of a project, people often gloss over the why.\nHow will we measure success?\nThis question is significant because Measures flesh out and anchor what the Objectives really mean. Until you define how success will be measured, even the most sincere visions are no more than highfalutin‚Äô fluff.\nWhat other conditions must exist?\nThis third question puts your project, issue, or initiative into a larger strategic context. Asking this expands the analysis to include some of the outside factors which may disrupt your carefully crafted plans.\nHow do we get there?\nThe majority of project teams I have worked with tend to delve deep into the details much too soon, or get sidelined by premature technical arguments. They gloss over the first three questions in a rush to get moving. The value of the fourth question comes from consciously placing it in its only, truly functional place in the planning sequence: Last."

The four strategic questions offer a user friendly way to learn and apply this tool. These questions are inherently embedded in the matrix and answering them helps you design your project in a way that connect all the dots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative LogFrame Diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Are We Trying To Accomplish And Why? (Objectives)\nThe first column describes Objectives and the If-Then logic linking them together. The LogFrame makes important distinctions among various ‚Äúlevels‚Äù of Objectives: Strategic intention (Goal), project impact (Purpose), project deliverables (Outcomes), and the key action steps (Inputs).\nHow Will We Measure Success? (Measures and Verifications)\n\nThe second column identifies the Measures of sucess for Objectives at each level. here wew select appropriate Measures and choose quantity, quality, and time indicators to clarify what each Objective means.\nThe third column summarizes how we will verify the status of the Measures at eaech level. Think of the Verification column as the project‚Äôs management information and feedback system.\n\nWhat Other Conditions Must Exist? (Assumptions)\nThe fourth column captures Assumptions; those ever-present, but often neglected risk factors outside of the project, on which project success depends. Defining and testing Assumptions lets you spot potential problems and deal with them in advance.\nHow do we get There? (Inputs)\nThe bottom row captures the project action plan: Who does what, when, and with what resources. Conventional project management like Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) and Gantt chart schedules fit here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogFrame Tips\n\n\n\n\n\nLogFrame Tips\n\nTreat the matrix as a summary. Keep it clear and concise; supplement with other documents.\nMake sure everyone on the team has working understanding of the LogFrame (at a minimum, knowing the four critical questions).\nMake sure the right peopole are involved. Invite key stakeholders to participate in project planning.\nStress the importance of the process of planning as much as the plan that comes out of the planning process. Supplement liberally with other supporting tools.\nIterate to make it great. Consider the first Logframe to be a rough draft that will require revision and reworking, perhaps through many cycles.\nBuild in specific milestones on the calendar at which you refine and revise the matrix in the light of new information.\nMonitor and manage changing Assumptions over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning a Problem Into a Set of Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning a Problem Into a Set of Objectives\nA problem is simply a project in disguise.

Spend some time carefully diagnosing the problem because the way you define it shapes the range of solution options. Don‚Äôt get sucked in by an over-simplified definition, catch phrase, or symptom. Get at the root causes. Find the right problem to solve.\nStakeholder collaboration during problem analysis builds shared understanding, generates better solution approaches, and greases the skids for smoother execution.\n\nAsk Your Stakeholders\n\nWhat do you see as the problem?\nWhy is this a problem and for whom?\nWhat causes the problem?\nWhat are the consequences if we ignore the problem?\nHow will you know when the problem is gone?\nWhat benefits will a solution bring?\nWhat might an ideal solution look like?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring Distinctions Among LogFrame Levels\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring Distinctions Among LogFrame Levels\n\nGoal: The Big Picture Impact\nThe Goal is the big picture context ‚Äî the overarching corporate or strategic Objective to which your project, and usually other projects, contribute.\nSome typical Goal examples:\n\nDelight our customers\nBecome the top provider in the market\nIncrease corporate profits\nEnsure reliability of the nuclear stockpile\nFoster a climate of innovation\nBe the global leader in safety education\n\nThese secondary trigger questions can help you get to the priamary Goal of a project:\n\nWhat is the higher corporate or strategic Objective to which this project contributes?\nWhy is the project‚Äôs impact important?\nWhat should happen after we achieve the Purpose?\nWhat is the big picture reason for doing this project?\n\n\n\nPurpose: The Project Sweet Spot\nPurpose is the vital, often missing focus that expresses the desired result or the impact we expect the project deliverables to produce.

The collaborative use of the LogFrame helps you simultaneously build and shape a strong team while they work together to create an actionable plan.\nMake sure that everyone speaks the same language by agreeing on what your key terms mean and using them in a consistent way.\nThe LogFrame matrix usually shows four levels, but Objectives above the Goal can be included to illustrate a higher level of impact. The higher up the hierarchy we climb, the more long-term, general, and ‚Äúvision-sounding‚Äù these Objectives become.\nDon‚Äôt ask ‚ÄúHows it going on this task?‚Äú Instead, ask:\n\nAre you having difficulties that would keep you from meeting targets?\nAre you getting the support you need from others?\nIs there anything else I should know about this?\nWhat do you need from me?\n\nProject monitoring asks ‚ÄúAre we on track?‚Äú; project reviews ask ‚ÄúAre we on the right track?‚Äú Use the LogFrame to challenge your strategy by posing questions such as:\n\nIs our Purpose still valid? What‚Äôs our progress toward Purpose?\nIs our Purpose likely to be achieved with this plan? Will this Purpose get us to the Goal?\nWhat is the status of Assumptions?\nAre these the right Outcomes? Are we producing them effectively?\nShould new Outcomes or Assumptions be added?

    "text": "My friend Anthony Coache and I have been curious about uses and misuses of the adjusted \\(R^2\\) coefficient which comes up in linear regression for model comparison and as a measure of ‚Äúgoodness of fit‚Äù. We were underwhelmed by the depth of the literature arguing for its use, and wanted to show exactly how it behaves under certain sets of assumptions. Investigating the issue brought us to re-interpret the adjusted \\(R^2\\) and to highlight a new distribution-free perspective on nested model comparison which is equivalent, under Gaussian assumptions, to Fisher‚Äôs classical \\(F\\)-test. This generalizes to nested GLMs comparison and provides exact comparison tests that are not based on asymptotic approximations. We still have many questions to answer, but here‚Äôs some of what we‚Äôve done.\nSo, in the context of least squares linear regression, the model for relating a vector of \\(n\\) observed responses \\(Y\\) to \\(p-1\\) independent covariates is \\(Y = X \\beta + \\varepsilon\\), where \\(X\\) is the design matrix and \\(\\varepsilon\\) is the vector of random errors. One of many summary statistics arising from data analyses based on this model is the adjusted \\(R^2\\) coefficient, defined as\n\\[R^2_a(Y, X) = 1 - \\frac{\\|\\hat \\varepsilon\\|^2}{\\left\\|Y - \\bar Y \\right\\|^2}\\frac{n-1}{n-p},\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat \\varepsilon\\) is the vector of residual errors and \\(\\bar Y\\) is the mean of \\(Y\\) (Cramer, 1987; Ohtani, 2004). The \\(R^2\\) coefficient and its adjusted counterpart are widely used as measures of goodness of fit, as model selection criteria and as estimators of the squared multiple correlation coefficient \\(\\rho^2\\) of the parent population. While their properties have been thoroughly studied in these contexts (Olkin, 1958; Helland, 1987; Cramer, 1987; Meepagala, 1992; Ohtani, 2004), the literature is scarce in explanations as to what, exactly, \\(R^2_a\\) adjusts for in non-trivial cases. It is not an unbiased estimator of \\(\\rho^2\\) and the degrees of freedom adjustment heuristic (Theil, 1971) is of limited depth.\nHere we show in what sense the adjusted \\(R^2\\) coefficient may be considered ‚Äúunbiased‚Äù. For nested models comparison, we also suggest how to test the significance of a \\(R^2_a\\) difference between two nested models which is equivalent to Fisher‚Äôs \\(F\\)-test under Gaussian assymptions. The \\(R^2_a\\) test is however done from a largely distribution-free perspective which is conditional on the observation of \\(Y\\). The results are then reinterpreted under classical Gaussian assumptions, which emphasize the dual perspectives between those two tests."

    "text": "Testing for an increase of \\(R^2_a\\)\nSuppose we have two design matrices \\(X\\) and \\(\\tilde X\\), where \\(\\text{Span}(X) \\subset \\text{Span}(\\tilde X)\\). Let \\(p=\\text{rank}(X)\\) and \\(\\tilde p = \\text{rank}(\\tilde X) = p+k\\). Given the vector of observations \\(Y\\), we observe two values \\(R^2 _ a (Y, X)\\) and \\(R^2_ a (Y, \\tilde X)\\) associated to the nested models. The classical way to test for a significant increase of \\(R^2 _ a\\) is to carry out Fisher‚Äôs \\(F\\)-test based on the statistics\n\\[\nF = \\frac{\\| \\hat Y_0 - \\hat Y \\|^2}{\\| Y - \\hat Y \\|^2} \\frac{n - \\tilde p }{k},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat Y_0 = P_X Y\\) and \\(\\hat Y = P_ {\\tilde X}Y\\). This is a function of both \\(R^2_a(Y, X)\\) and \\(R^2_a(Y, \\tilde X)\\), which, under the assumption\n\\[\nH_0: \\quad Y = X \\beta + \\varepsilon\n\\]\nfor \\(\\varepsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 I_n)\\), has an \\(F\\)-distribution.\nThis is, however, a rather convoluted way of going about comparing the two numbers \\(R^2_a(Y, X)\\) and \\(R^2_a(Y, \\tilde X)\\). Can we do simpler, and can we drop the Gaussian assumption? The answer is yes, although we‚Äôll have to change a bit our point of view on the problem.\n\nA Dual perspective on nested model comparison\nThe whole point of nested model comparison is to see if the new covariates in \\(\\tilde X\\), i.e.¬†those that are not part of \\(\\text{Span}(X)\\), bring new information about \\(Y\\). In the context of an exploratory analysis where the observations and predictors are all observed, we propose to change our perspective to the following testing procedure:\n\ncondition on the observation of \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) (consider them fixed, observed values);\ntests if the new covariates in \\(\\tilde X\\) are random noise.\n\nHence, rather than testing the model \\(Y = X\\beta + \\varepsilon\\) under a Gaussian noise assumption, we test for covariate randomness, our null hypothesis becomes\n\\[\nH_0':\\quad \\text{the complement of $\\text{Span}(X)$ in $\\text{Span}(\\tilde X)$ is a random subspace.}\n\\]\nThis test can be carried out using any test statistic \\(T\\), and obviously the distribution of \\(T\\) under \\(H_0'\\) (and conditionally on \\(Y\\)), will not depend on the unknown parameter \\(\\beta\\) nor on the noise structure \\(\\varepsilon\\) (which has been conditionned out of randomness). In particular, we can take \\(T = R^2_a(Y, \\tilde X)\\).\nDoes it make any sense? Well it does not change anything! The test obtained in this framework is entirely equivalent to Fisher‚Äôs \\(F\\)-test we reviewed before: for any given observation of \\(Y\\), \\(X\\) and \\(\\tilde X\\), the two tests will give the same results.\nLet me make all of this more precise.\n\n\nSome precisions\nLet \\(\\tilde X = [X \\; W] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times \\tilde p}\\) be the concatenation of \\(X\\) with a matrix \\(W = [W_1 \\, \\cdots \\, W_k]\\) of \\(k\\) new covariates. The goal is to test whether or not \\(R^2_a(Y, \\tilde X)\\) has significantly increased from \\(R^2_a(Y, X)\\). Henceforth, we shall assume that both \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) are fixed and the null hypothesis is\n\\[\nH_0':\\; \\text{ the } W_i \\text{ are independent and of uniformly distributed directions.}\n\\]\nBy saying that \\(W_i\\) has a uniformly distributed direction, we mean that \\(W_i/\\|W_i\\|\\) is uniformly distributed on the \\(n\\)-sphere. This is satisfied, for instance, if \\(W_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma_i^2 I_n)\\) and this represents the augmentation of the covariate space through random directions. It is equivalent to saying that the complement of \\(\\text{Span}(X)\\) in \\(\\text{Span}(\\tilde X)\\) is a random subspace. The following proposition shows that the expected value of \\(R^2_a(Y, \\tilde X)\\) is invariant under the addition of such covariates and provides the distribution of \\(R^2_a(Y, \\tilde X)\\) under \\(H_0'\\).\nProposition 1. Let \\(Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) and \\(X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}\\) be fixed and let \\(\\tilde X = [X \\; W_1 \\, \\cdots \\, W_k]\\) be the concatenation of \\(X\\) with \\(k \\leq n- p\\) independent random vectors \\(W_1, \\ldots, W_k\\) of uniformly distributed directions. Then\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[ R^2_a(Y, \\tilde X) \\right] = R^2_a(Y, X).\n\\]\nand, more precisely, under \\(H_0\\) we have that \\(R^2_a(Y, \\tilde X)\\) is distributed as\n\\[\n1-  \\frac{(n-1)\\| \\hat \\varepsilon \\|^2}{(n-\\tilde p) \\| Y - \\bar Y \\|^2}\\text{Beta}\\left(\\tfrac{n-\\tilde p}{2}, \\tfrac{k}{2} \\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\text{Beta}\\left(\\tfrac{(n-\\tilde p)}{2}, \\tfrac{k}{2} \\right)\\) is a Beta random variable of parameters \\((n-\\tilde p)/2\\) and \\(k/2\\).\nProof. Let \\(\\omega\\) be the projection of \\([W_1 \\, \\cdots \\, W_k]\\) on the orthogonal \\(V\\) of \\(\\text{Span}(X)\\) and denote by \\(P_\\omega\\) the orthogonal projection onto \\(V_\\omega =  \\text{Span}(\\omega)\\). By the Pythagorean theorem we have \\(\\|Y - P_ {\\tilde X} Y \\|^2 + \\|P_\\omega \\hat \\varepsilon\\|^2 = \\|\\hat \\varepsilon\\|^2\\) and hence we may write\n\\[\n    R^2_a(Y, \\tilde X) = 1- \\frac{(n-1)\\|\\hat \\varepsilon\\|^2}{(n-\\tilde p) \\left\\| Y - \\bar Y\\right\\|^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\|P_\\omega \\hat \\varepsilon\\|^2}{\\|\\hat \\varepsilon\\|^2} \\right).\n\\]\nWe now derive the distribution of \\(\\|P_\\omega \\hat \\varepsilon\\|^2/\\|\\hat \\varepsilon\\|^2\\). This term is the squared norm of projection of the unit vector \\(\\hat \\varepsilon / \\|\\hat \\varepsilon\\| \\in V\\) on the random subspace \\(V_\\omega \\subset V\\). Let us now introduce a random unitary matrix \\(U\\) obtained by orthonormalizing \\(\\dim(V) = n - p\\) random vectors of uniformly distributed directions, so that \\(P_\\omega \\hat \\varepsilon\\) is distributed as the first \\(k\\) components of the vector \\(U \\hat \\varepsilon\\). Since \\(U\\hat \\varepsilon / \\|\\hat \\varepsilon\\|\\) is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere of \\(V\\), it follows that the squared norm of its first \\(k\\) components has a \\(\\text{Beta}(k/2, (n-\\tilde p)/2)\\) distribution. In other words, we have shown that \\(\\|P_\\omega \\hat \\varepsilon\\|^2/\\|\\hat \\varepsilon\\|^2 \\sim \\text{Beta}\\left(\\tfrac{k}{2}, \\tfrac{n-\\tilde p}{2} \\right)\\).\nThe expectation of \\(R^2_a(Y, \\tilde X)\\) is obtained from this distributional expression. \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\nReinterpretation under Gaussian hypotheses\nWhile the preceding analysis was conditional on the observation of \\(Y\\), suppose now that \\(Y = X \\beta + \\varepsilon\\), where \\(\\varepsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\) for some \\(\\sigma^2 &gt; 0\\). The distribution of \\(R^2_a(Y, X)\\) is then intricately related to the unknown parameter \\(\\beta\\), preventing a direct analysis.\nHowever, as shown in Cramer (1987), the adjusted \\(R^2\\) coefficient can still be understood as compensating for irrelevant covariates: in a correctly specified model, its expected value is invariant under the addition of covariates. This is formalized in Proposition 2 below. We preferred a more elementary proof than found therein, avoiding the rather involved explicit expression of the expected value that depends on the unknown parameter \\(\\beta\\).\nProposition 2. Suppose \\(Y = X \\beta + \\varepsilon\\), where \\(\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}\\) and \\(\\varepsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 I_n)\\) is Gaussian noise. If \\(\\tilde X\\) is another design matrix of rank \\(\\tilde p\\) such that \\(\\text{Span}(X) \\subset \\text{Span}(\\tilde X)\\), then\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[ R^2_a(Y, \\tilde X) \\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[R^2_a(Y, X)\\right].\n\\]\nRemark. More precisely, we know the conditional distribution of \\(R^2_a(Y, \\tilde X)\\) given \\(R^2_a(Y, X)\\): it is the same as the distribution which appears in the context of Proposition 1. The above results then follows from a simple computation.\nProof. Let \\(\\hat \\varepsilon^{*} = Y - P_ {\\tilde X} Y\\) and write \\(\\lambda = \\left\\|\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y - \\bar Y\\right]\\right\\|^2/\\sigma^2\\). Then \\(\\frac{\\|\\hat \\varepsilon^{*}\\|^2}{\\left\\|Y - \\bar Y\\right\\|^2}\\) is distributed as \\[\n    \\frac{\\sum_ {i=1}^{n - \\tilde p} Z_i^2}{\\sum_ {i=1}^{n - \\tilde p} Z_i^2 + \\chi^2_ {\\tilde p -1} (\\lambda)}\n\\]\nfor independent \\(Z_i \\sim N(0,1)\\) and \\(\\chi^2_ {\\tilde p - 1} (\\lambda)\\) a noncentral \\(\\chi^2\\) random variable of parameter \\(\\lambda\\).

Recall that the \\(F\\)-statistic for Fisher‚Äôs test with nested models of \\(p\\) and \\(\\tilde p = p + k\\) parameters respectively is given by\n\\[\nF = \\frac{\\| \\hat Y_0 - \\hat Y \\|^2}{\\| Y - \\hat Y \\|^2} \\frac{n - \\tilde p }{k},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat Y_0 = P_X Y\\) and \\(\\hat Y = P_{\\tilde X} Y\\) are the vector of predicted values for the models corresponding to \\(X\\) and \\(\\tilde X\\). The test of significance devised in Section 2, based on \\(R^2_a(Y, \\tilde X)\\), is then equivalent to Fisher‚Äôs \\(F\\)-test of the hypothesis\n\\[\nH_0^{\\text{Gauss}}:\\; Y = X\\beta + \\varepsilon\\, \\text{ where }\\,\\varepsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 I_n).\n\\]\nTo see this, let \\(\\omega\\) be, as in the proof of Proposition 1, the projection of \\([W_1\\,\\cdots\\,W_k]\\) on the orthogonal of \\(\\text{Span}(X)\\) and denote by \\(P_\\omega\\) the projection on \\(\\text{Span}(\\omega)\\). Then the \\(F\\)-statistic can be written as\n\\[\n    F = \\frac{\\|P_\\omega \\hat \\varepsilon\\|^2}{\\|\\hat \\varepsilon - P_\\omega \\hat \\varepsilon \\|^2} \\frac{n-\\tilde p}{k} = \\frac{\\|P_\\omega \\hat \\varepsilon\\|^2/\\|\\hat \\varepsilon\\|^2}{1 - \\|P_\\omega \\hat \\varepsilon \\|^2/\\|\\hat \\varepsilon\\|^2} \\frac{n-\\tilde p}{k}.\n\\]\nThis is a monotonous invertible transform of \\(\\|P_\\omega \\hat \\varepsilon\\|^2/\\|\\hat \\varepsilon\\|^2\\) which, under \\(H_0^{\\text{Gauss}}\\), follows a Beta distribution of parameters \\(k/2\\) and \\((n-\\tilde p)/2\\). Yet in the framework of Section 2 and under \\(H_0\\), where now \\(\\omega\\) is random and \\(\\hat \\varepsilon\\) fixed, the test statistic \\(R^2_ a(Y, \\tilde X)\\) is also a monotonous invertible function of \\(\\|P_ \\omega \\hat \\varepsilon\\|^2/\\|\\hat \\varepsilon\\|^2 \\sim \\text{Beta}(k/2, (n-\\tilde p)/2)\\). This shows that the two unilateral tests are equivalent: the same observations yield the same \\(p\\)-values."

    "text": "Discussion\nWe have highlighted dual perspectives on nested models comparison. An increase of \\(R^2\\) may be due to random noise that correlates with fixed regressors, or to random regressors that correlate with fixed observations. Fisher‚Äôs test of the first hypothesis is equivalent to the \\(R^2_a\\) test of the second. Furthermore, we showed that \\(R^2_a\\) compensates properly, on the average, for both types of inflation of \\(R^2\\). We suggest this provides a clear explanation of what \\(R^2_a\\) exactly adjusts for and how it can properly be used for models comparison.\nFurthermore, the fact that random covariate tests, conditional on the observations, can be carried out exactly using any measure of goodness of fit (e.g.¬†the likelihood or the AIC) suggests that our approach may be helpful in devising nested model comparison tests for GLMs. Testing at a chosen confidence level also provides more flexibility than using a rule-based procedure such as the AIC.\nReferences\n\nCramer, J.

This leads to under-specified systems which do not perform as well as they could.\n\nThe paper goes on to define clear tasks for entity resolution systems and detail issues with current benchmarks:\n\n\n‚ÄúOur findings reveal that previous benchmarks biased the evaluation of the progress of current entity matching approaches, and there is still a long way to go to build effective entity matchers.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CopyrightOlivier Binette"
