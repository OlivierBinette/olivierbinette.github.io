My advanced\nskills in data science, machine learning, and applied research, as well\nas my programming skills in Python and R, make me well-equipped to\ntackle a wide range of data-driven projects.\nI have gained practical experience through internships and academic\nresearch, and have developed and published multiple software packages. I\nhave experience in project management and leadership, having led teams\nof interns on data science projects, managed a large research\ncollaboration, and supervised data-labeling staff. I am also skilled in\nteaching and mentoring, and have led weekly labs on topics such as\nentity resolution, spatio-temporal models, Bayesian and modern\nstatistics, and introduction to data science.\nSome of my notable accomplishments include:\nDeveloping and implementing a model evaluation and improvement\nstrategy for machine learning-based entity resolution systems at the\nAmerican Institutes for Research\nDeveloping and implementing uncertainty quantification and Bayesian\noptimization methods for pricing optimization at the Intact Financial\nCorporation\nDeveloping survey methodology for food insecurity monitoring adopted\nby Duke University\nTraining and leading undergraduate students on internship projects\ninvolving data analysis and web development for the Information\nInitiative at Duke\nPublishing research papers on Bayesian nonparametric inference in\ntop journals such as the Journal of Machine Learning Research, IEEE\nTransactions on Information Theory, and Journal of Statistical Planning\nand Inference\nPlease don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or\nwould like to discuss potential consulting projects. I look forward to\nthe opportunity to work with you!\nUse the form below to book a time to chat:\n\n\n\n\n\n",

See my research, teaching, software, and blog.\nAbout me\nI am a PhD candidate in the Statistical Science Department at Duke\nUniversity, where I am supported by Professor Jerry Reiter and funded by\nan Alexander-Graham-Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship and a doctoral\naward from the Fonds de Recherche du Qu√©bec - Nature et Technologies. I\nhold a B.Sc. in Mathematics and an M.Sc. in Statistics from Universit√©\ndu Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al, where I received the Canada Governor General‚Äôs\nAcademic Medal in 2020.\nMy research focuses on statistical evaluation of machine learning\nsystems and entity resolution for big data integration. My work combines\nmachine learning and statistics to address applied problems in these\nareas. I have interned at the Intact Financial Corporation and the\nAmerican Institutes for Research, where I worked on projects involving\nmachine learning and entity resolution, respectively.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy contributing to the academic community at\nDuke. I have been a research coordinator for the Duke\nGPSG Community Pantry, webmaster for the Record Linkage Interest\nGroup, and a mentor for the Twoples directed reading program. I have\nalso worked with the Duke Applied Machine Learning Group and the Data+\nprogram as a project manager. Additionally, I regularly mentor\nundergraduate students working on research projects with me.\nI work on open source projects related to my research. I maintain\nthree R packages on CRAN and Python packages for scalable fuzzy string\nmatching and entity resolution evaluation. My work is supported by\nindividual contributors through Github Sponsors\nand by G-Research.\nSponsor me\nYou can support my open source work and community involvement through\nGithub Sponsors:\n\n\n\n\nHire me\nI offer consulting services to small and medium-sized businesses on\ntopics such as record linkage and deduplication, survey methods, data\nanalysis, R/Python package development, and statistical learning. Learn\nmore on my consulting\npage\nThank you for considering me for your project or opportunity. I look\nforward to connecting with you!\n\n\n\n",
