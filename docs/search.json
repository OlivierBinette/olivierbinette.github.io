      "contents": "\n\nI am Olivier, a PhD student in the Statistical Science department at Duke University. I hold a Mathematics B.Sc. and a Statistics M.Sc. from Université du Québec à Montréal. My research is currently supported by Professor Rebecca C. Steorts at Duke, by an Alexander-Graham-Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship, and by a doctoral award from the Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Nature et Technologies. I was awarded the Canada Governor General’s Academic Medal in 2020 for outstanding academic achievements during my M.Sc.\nI have broad ranging interests in statistics. My M.Sc. research focused on theoretical properties of Bayesian nonparametric procedures. Recently, I have been working on more applied problems. I am particularly interested in issues surrounding inference with “big” administrative data, as well as using such data to better represent hidden populations in official statistics. This research involves privacy considerations, entity resolution for data integration and multiple systems estimation to account for undercoverage.\nIn my free time, I like to get involved with other students on campus. I work with the Duke Applied Machine Learning Group and with the Data+ program as a project manager, I am a mentor for the Twoples directed reading program, and I am involved with the Graduate and Professional Student Government (as a representative and with the Community Pantry). I am very grateful for our international academic community and I try to give back as I can.\nWhat’s on here?\nThis website lists some of what I do. Check out my research, teaching, and software.\nLinks\nSome things I find interesting:\n“23 things I didn’t learn in college or grad school.” A Twitter collection by D.

      "contents": "\nI am committed to making the world a better place through my work. The most fundamental values which underpin my commitment are listed below.\nI have always thought of mathematics and statistics as liberal arts. They are tools to help us make better sense of the world. I want to pursue research in a way which is compatible with this point of view and which ultimately promotes free and critical thought.\nI want my research, teaching, and mentoring to be positive not just in terms of their direct intended purposes, but also through their collateral effects. This includes their effects on well-being, on intellectual training, and on personal growth for trainees, students, collaborators, and for the broader community.\nI want my research to be open and freely accessible. Feedback and criticism is always welcome.\nI want to acknowledge uncertainty and uphold truth in my work, despite potential pressure to the contrary. Too often we see wild claims from weak observational studies in the scientific literature. Science cannot be reduced to “\\(p < 0.05\\)”.\nCompromises are necessary to rally people. I do not compromise on core principles of truth and inclusivity, but I otherwise want to be accommodating with collegiality in mind.\n\n\n\n",
