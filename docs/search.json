    "text": "I am mostly a ‚Äútechnical‚Äù person. This means I tend to work on technology problems that have technology solutions. I‚Äôm interested in non-technological things as well, but it‚Äôs not my expertise.\nIn my field, learning about a new technology can feel like gaining a superpower. Think about being able to build a custom ChatGPT - it‚Äôs exciting!\nWith this comes the thought: ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be nice if I solved problem Y using technology X?‚Äù\nUnfortunately, the answer to this question is typically a resounding ‚Äúno.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs not that problem Y is not important. Or that technology X can‚Äôt help with problem Y. The problem is that product development is hard.\nIf I went about building a solution fueled only by my technological enthusiasm, then I would likely fail. It has happened to me before.\nMost people don‚Äôt care about technology. They care about a job to be done. They want to gain a superpower of their own.\n\n\n\nhttps://jtbd.info/2-what-is-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd-796b82081cca\n\n\nBuilding a good product requires understanding what your customer/client wants to get done. To understand where, when, and why they might want to use your product.\nThis is a science of its own. It‚Äôs not a technological problem, it‚Äôs a human problem. And it‚Äôs not my expertise.\nAs technologists, we need to embrace our backline role. We need to call on non-technologists to guide the creation of great products that empower others, or learn the skills we need to get this done through training from experts or experience working with experts.\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CopyrightOlivier Binette"
