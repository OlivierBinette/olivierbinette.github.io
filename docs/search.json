      "contents": "\nBackground\nI have been trained as a mathematician and statistician at Université du Québec à Montréal (B.Sc. and M.Sc.), where I developed my interest in Bayesian nonparametrics and statistical learning theory. Prior to college, I would spend most of my time programming (in Java, C, some Javascript and PHP, VHDL) and working on microelectronics projects.\nRecently, I have been focusing on more applied statistical problems - I want my work to have a positive impact on people’s life. I am particularly interested in sound statistical inference using administrative data, as well as using such data to better represent hidden populations in official statistics. This ties to my ongoing work with Professor Rebecca Steorts on entity resolution and multiple systems estimation.\nIn my free time, I like to get involved with other student on campus. I’m grateful for our international academic community and I try to give back as I can.\nWhat’s on here?\nThis website lists some of what I do. Check out my research, my software, and my blog.\nNews\n11/28/2020 - My package assert version 1.0.1 has just been released!\n11/28/2020 - New website is up! I’ve imported a few of my blog posts from the past years.\n08/10/2020 - Our paper (Almost) All of Entity Resolution is now on arXiv.\nLinks\nSome things I find interesting (more to come):\n“23 things I didn’t learn in college or grad school.” A Twitter collection by D. Sivakumar.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nI am committed to making the world a better place through my work. The most fundamental values which underpin my commitment are listed below.\nI have always thought of mathematics and statistics as liberal arts. They are tools to help us make better sense of the world. I want to pursue research in a way which is compatible with this point of view and which ultimately promotes free and critical thought.\nI want my research, teaching, and mentoring to be positive not just in terms of their direct intended purposes, but also through their collateral effects. This includes their effects on well-being, on intellectual training, and on personal growth for trainees, students, collaborators, and for the broader community.\nI want my research to be open and freely accessible. Feedback and criticism is always welcome.\nI want to acknowledge uncertainty and uphold truth in my work, despite potential pressure to the contrary. Too often we see wild claims from weak observational studies in the scientific literature. Science cannot be reduced to “\\(p < 0.05\\)”.\nCompromises are necessary to rally people. I do not compromise on core principles of truth and inclusivity, but I otherwise want to be accommodating with collegiality in mind.\n\n\n\n",
