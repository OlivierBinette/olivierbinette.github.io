See my research, teaching, software, and blog.\nAbout me\nI am a PhD candidate in the Statistical Science Department at Duke\nUniversity, where I am supported by Professor Jerry Reiter and funded by\nan Alexander-Graham-Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship and a doctoral\naward from the Fonds de Recherche du Qu√©bec - Nature et Technologies. I\nhold a B.Sc. in Mathematics and an M.Sc. in Statistics from Universit√©\ndu Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al, where I received the Canada Governor General‚Äôs\nAcademic Medal in 2020.\nMy research focuses on statistical evaluation of machine learning\nsystems and entity resolution for big data integration. My work combines\nmachine learning and statistics to address applied problems in these\nareas. I have interned at the Intact Financial Corporation and the\nAmerican Institutes for Research, where I worked on projects involving\nmachine learning and entity resolution, respectively.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy contributing to the academic community at\nDuke. I have been a research coordinator for the Duke\nGPSG Community Pantry, webmaster for the Record Linkage Interest\nGroup, and a mentor for the Twoples directed reading program. I have\nalso worked with the Duke Applied Machine Learning Group and the Data+\nprogram as a project manager. Additionally, I regularly mentor\nundergraduate students working on research projects with me.\nI work on open source projects related to my research. I maintain\nthree R packages on CRAN and Python packages for scalable fuzzy string\nmatching and entity resolution evaluation. My work is supported by\nindividual contributors through Github Sponsors\nand by G-Research.\nSponsor me\nYou can support my open source work and community involvement through\nGithub Sponsors:\n\n\n\n\nHire me\nI offer consulting services to small and medium-sized businesses on\ntopics such as record linkage and deduplication, survey methods, data\nanalysis, R/Python package development, and statistical learning. Learn\nmore on my consulting\npage\nThank you for considering me for your project or opportunity. I look\nforward to connecting with you!\n\n\n\n",
