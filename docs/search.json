Check out my research, teaching, and software.\nAbout me\nI am a PhD Candidate in the Statistical Science Department at Duke\nUniversity. I have a Mathematics B.Sc. and a Statistics M.Sc. from\nUniversit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al. My research is currently supported by\nProfessor Rebecca C. Steorts at Duke, by an Alexander-Graham-Bell Canada\nGraduate Scholarship, and by a doctoral award from the Fonds de\nRecherche du Qu√©bec - Nature et Technologies. I was awarded the Canada\nGovernor General‚Äôs Academic Medal in 2020 for outstanding academic\nachievements during my M.Sc.\nI have broad ranging interests in statistics. My M.Sc. research\nfocused on theoretical properties of Bayesian nonparametric procedures.\nRecently, I have been working on more applied problems. I am\nparticularly interested in issues surrounding inference with ‚Äúbig‚Äù\nadministrative data, as well as using such data to better represent\nhidden populations in official statistics. This research involves\nprivacy considerations, entity resolution for data integration and\nmultiple systems estimation to account for missing data.\nThroughout Spring 2022, I am working as a Data Scientist intern at\nthe Intact\nFinancial Corporation. I am part of the Rating Revolution team which\ndevelops machine learning models to improve the pricing of insurance\nproducts.\n\nIn my free time, I like to get involved with other students at Duke.\nI am Research Coordinator for the Duke\nGPSG Community Pantry, helping improve our knowledge of food\ninsecurity on campus. I am also webmaster for the Record Linkage Interest\nGroup. Additionally, I worked with the Duke Applied Machine Learning\nGroup and with the Data+ program as a project manager, and I have been a\nmentor for the Twoples directed reading program. I am very grateful for\nour international academic community and I try to give back as I\ncan.\nLastly, I spend some time working on open source projects related to\nmy research. I maintain three R packages on CRAN and I am actively\nworking on an open source\nPython library for scalable fuzzy string matching. My work is\nsupported by individual contributors through Github Sponsors\nand by G-Research.\nSponsor me\nSponsor my open source work and community involvement through\nGithub:\n\n\n\n\nHire me\nI consult with small and medium-sized businesses on the topics of\nrecord linkage and deduplication, survey methods, data analysis,\nR/Python package development, and statistical learning.
