# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

This website lists some of what I do. Check out my [ research](./research.html), [teaching](./teaching.html), and [software](./software.html).

### About me

I am a PhD Candidate in the Statistical Science Department at Duke University. I have a Mathematics B.Sc. and a Statistics M.Sc. from UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec Ã  MontrÃ©al. My research is currently supported by Professor Rebecca C. Steorts at Duke, by an Alexander-Graham-Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship, and by a doctoral award from the Fonds de Recherche du QuÃ©bec - Nature et Technologies. I was awarded the Canada Governor General's Academic Medal in 2020 for outstanding academic achievements during my M.Sc.

I have broad ranging interests in statistics. My M.Sc. research focused on theoretical properties of Bayesian nonparametric procedures. Recently, I have been working on more applied problems. I am particularly interested in issues surrounding inference with "big" administrative data, as well as using such data to better represent hidden populations in official statistics. This research involves privacy considerations, entity resolution for data integration and multiple systems estimation to account for missing data. 

Throughout Spring 2022, I am working as a Data Scientist intern at the [Intact Financial Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intact_Financial). I am part of the Rating Revolution team which develops machine learning models to improve the pricing of insurance products. During Summer 2022, I will be working as a Data Scientist intern at the [American Institutes for Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Institutes_for_Research) for a contract with the U.S. Patents and Trademarks Office.

In my free time, I like to get involved with other students at Duke. I am Research Coordinator for the [Duke GPSG Community Pantry](https://gpsg.duke.edu/resources-for-students/community-pantry/), helping improve our knowledge of food insecurity on campus. I have also worked with the Duke Applied Machine Learning Group and with the Data+ program as a project manager, and I have been a mentor for the Twoples directed reading program. I am very grateful for our international academic community and I try to give back as I can.
