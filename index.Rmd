I am Olivier, currently a PhD student in the Statistical Science department at Duke University. I hold a mathematics B.Sc. and a statistics M.Sc. from Université du Québec à Montréal.

I have broad ranging interests in statistics and recently I have been focusing on challenging applied problems. These relate to sound statistical inference using administrative data, as well as using such data to better represent hidden populations in official statistics.

In my free time, I like to get involved with other students on campus. I'm grateful for our international academic community and I try to give back as I can.
