# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

I'm Olivier, a data scientist at American Institutes for Research. I have a Ph.D. in Statistics from Duke University.

I specialize in applied data science R&D, in the statistical evaluation of AI/machine learning systems, and in entity resolution for data integration, cleaning, and enrichment. My work combines engineering, machine learning, and statistics to address applied problems in these areas.

I contribute to open source projects related to my research and I maintain various R and Python packages. My open-source work has previously been supported by individual contributors through Github Sponsors and by G-Research.


During Spring 2022, I was working as a Data Scientist intern at the [Intact Financial Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intact_Financial). I was part of the Rating Revolution team which develops machine learning models to improve the pricing of insurance products. 
<!--During Summer 2022, I will be working as a Data Scientist intern at the [American Institutes for Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Institutes_for_Research) for a contract with the U.S. Patents and Trademarks Office.

During Summer 2022, I was working as a Data Scientist/Researcher Intern at the [American Institutes for Research](https://www.air.org/). I worked on the entity resolution algorithms used for [PatentsView.org](https://patentsview.org/), a patents knowledge discovery platform led by the Office of the Chief Economist at the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. I developed novel evaluation methodology for entity resolution systems (see [our paper](media/PatentsView_Evaluation.pdf)).


In my free time, I enjoy contributing to the academic community at Duke. I have been a research coordinator for the [Duke GPSG Community Pantry](https://gpsg.duke.edu/resources-for-students/community-pantry/), webmaster for the [Record Linkage Interest Group](https://sites.google.com/view/rlig), and a mentor for the Twoples directed reading program. I have also worked with the Duke Applied Machine Learning Group and the Data+ program as a project manager. Additionally, I regularly mentor undergraduate students working on research projects with me.
