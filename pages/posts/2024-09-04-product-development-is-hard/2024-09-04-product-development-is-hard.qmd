I am mostly a "technical" person. This means I tend to work on technology problems that have technology solutions. I’m interested in non-technological things as well, but it's not my expertise.

In my field, **learning about a new technology can feel like gaining a superpower.** Think about being able to build a custom ChatGPT - it’s exciting!

With this comes the thought: “Wouldn’t it be nice if I solved problem Y using technology X?”

Unfortunately, the answer to this question is typically a resounding “no.”

It’s not that problem Y is not important. Or that technology X can’t help with problem Y. The problem is that product development is hard.

If I went about building a solution fueled only by my technological enthusiasm, then I would likely fail. It has happened to me before.

Most people don’t care about technology. They care about a job to be done. **They want to gain a superpower of their own.**

Building a good product requires understanding what your customer/client wants to get done. To understand where, when, and why they might want to use your product.

This is a science of its own. It’s not a technological problem, it’s a human problem. And it’s not my expertise.

As technologists, we need to embrace our backline role. We need to call on non-technologists to guide the creation of great products that empower others, or learn the skills we need to get this done through training from experts or experience working with experts.
